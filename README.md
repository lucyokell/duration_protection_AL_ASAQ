# duration_protection_AL_ASAQ
R code ('scripts' folder) and transmission model executable and parameter files ('run transmission model' folder) associated with the preprint by Bretscher et al: A pooled analysis of the duration of chemoprophylaxis against malaria after treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine.
The associated data and analysis output are stored in the Zenodo repository, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3339215
The R scripts were originally written by Michael Bretscher, with later modifications by Lucy Okell at Imperial College London and advice from Prabin Dahal and Kasia Stepniewska at the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network.
The code which created the executable file was written by Jamie Griffin at Queen Mary's University of London.
